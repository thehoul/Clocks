# Clocks

I try to learn JS by making clocks. When I think of a cool design, I try to make it using JS.

This is inspired by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUSCH7nQGIM)

### Environment

I use ubuntu 22 and VSCode. I use the [liveServer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension to run the visuals.
